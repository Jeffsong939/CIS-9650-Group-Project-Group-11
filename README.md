# CIS-9650-Group-Project

Our goal is to look at data to find out whether crime has increased since the 1980â€™s in different parts of the world. We also want to look at what specific types of crimes have become more or less common with time and what regions of the world are more or less dangerous.

Our data set is from Kaggle and you can find it here:
